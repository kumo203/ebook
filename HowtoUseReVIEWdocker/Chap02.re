= Pulling the image
To pull Re:VIEW Docker image, run the following command from your command prompt.
//list[PullVvwakameReview][][cmd]{
docker pull vvakame/review
//}
In prompt, it will be like this.
//image[pull-vvakame-review][]{
[OnGoing]Pulling vvakame/review
//}
It will take some time to finish downloading the all pulled image data, but after itâ€™s successfully done, it will be like this.
//image[pull-vvakame-review-comp][]{
